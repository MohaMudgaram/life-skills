# Decision making
The world's most powerful skill:

**Effective decision-making.**

But colleges eat up 4 years of our lives and don't even bother teaching it.

Instead, here are 10 quick lessons from psychology that will upgrade your decision-making in the next 5 minutes:
1. Decision fatigue:
    - Decision-making is a mentally demanding task.
    - And the quality of your decisions drops as you get more tired.
    - Don't make decisions when you're tired.
2. Survivorship bias:
    - We're all wowed by the rockstar CEO that dropped out of college.
    - But we overlook the 99% of dropouts who go on to fail.
    - Our brains get distracted by shiny exceptions.
    - Don't fall for exceptions when making a decision.
3. Social proof and groupthink:
    - We have a tendency to blindly copy our friends and colleagues.
    - But sometimes copying others has disastrous effects ― like smoking to fit in with your group.
    - Think twice before you start imitating those near you.
4. Confirmation bias:
    - We demand extraordinarily high evidence for views that do not fit our existing beliefs.
    - And accept extraordinarily low evidence for views that do.
    - Evaluate both pros and cons before making a decision.
5. Pay attention to new information:
    - Our brains are quick to form strong first impressions.
    - This means that our brains often underestimate the importance of new information.
    - Stupidity often comes from overlooking crucial new information.
    - Pay attention to it.
6. Sunk cost bias:
    - Just because you've spent time or money doing something doesn't mean you should keep doing it.
    - Gamblers will spend good money after bad.
    - People will spend years in unhappy relationships.
    - Learn to separate the past from the present when deciding.
7. Don't make decisions when you're emotional:
    - We've all made decisions in the moment that we regret later.
    - Why? Because we let our emotions get the best of us in the moment.
    - Be patient and wait to make decisions when  you're in a calm emotional state.
8. Leadership bias:
    - We often do things because someone in charge tells us to do it ― teachers, parents, bosses.
    - But sometimes this can have disastrous effects ― like leaders pushing their countries into unjustified wars.
    - Learn to think for yourself.
9. Dunning–Kruger Effect:
    - When we don't have the required skill, our brains compensate with overconfidence.
    - Think of all the people who buy crypto without knowing anything about it.
    - Psychologists call this the Dunning–Kruger Effect.
    - Don't let your confidence trick you.
10. Liking bias:
    - Often times we can fool ourselves into making a decision because we like the person in front of us.
    - That's why ads always feature attractive people - they know you like attractive people.
    - Don't do something just because you like the person asking you to do it.
